# Getting started with Roster Rosie

*"Who's running standup today? Any volunteers?.. [~crickets~]"*

*"Anyone remembers who's driving retro today? Let's have a look at the roster... [~painfully long pause~]... Does anyone have a link to the roster handy? I can't seem to locate it..."*

If the beginning of every Scrum meeting in your team sounds like this, than you are in the right place. Roster Rosie is a Slack assistant bot that saves your team members time (and awkwardness!) and tells you who the scrum master is exactly when you need it.

Here is what she can do:

- Get all team members
- Get current / next lead for standup or retrospective
- Rotate the current lead to the next person
- Inform your team about who is on duty via Slack message

Supported event types are: standup and retrospective.

<!-- If you would like to experiment, here is a **Postman collection** with sample requests for all available endpoints. -->

*P.S. This documentation example was written entirely by a human with no AI help, so there might be quirks. I choose to let them be though so that you get the idea of how my brain and language work without tech enhancement.*

*P.P.S. If you have a look at the code, you might notice that there are discrepancies between what is documented vs what is coded. The code is not very good and was written as a learning project back when I knew much less about REST principles than I do now, so some parts of the docs are a bit "inspired by", rather than the exact representation of the API endpoints. It's not ideal, but while the spare time is short, I'm keeping it as is since this documentation is a doc writing portfolio piece.*
