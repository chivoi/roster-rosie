# Roster Rosie

> *"Who's running standup today? Any volunteers?.. [crickets]"*

> *"Anyone remember who's driving the retro today? Let's have a look at the roster... [painfully long pause]... Does anyone have a link to the roster handy? I can't seem to locate it..."*

If the beginning of every Scrum meeting in your team sounds like this, then you are in the right place. Roster Rosie is a Slack assistant bot that saves your team members time (and awkwardness!), by telling you who the scrum leader is exactly when you need it.

Here is what she can do:

- List all team members
- Report on the current / next lead for standup or retrospective
- Rotate the current lead of the event to the next person on the roster
- Inform your team about who is on duty via Slack message

If you would like to experiment, here is a [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/chivoi/roster-rosie/collection/9m5cl9c/roster-rosie-request-examples?action=share&creator=14131077) with sample requests for all available endpoints.

*P.S. This documentation example was written entirely by a human with no AI help, so there might be quirks. I choose to let them be though so you get the idea of how my brain and language work without tech enhancement.*

*P.P.S. If you have a look at the code, you might notice that there are discrepancies between what is documented vs what is coded. The code was written as a learning project back when I knew much less about REST principles than I do now, so some parts of the docs are "inspired by", rather than the exact representation of the API endpoints. It's not ideal, but since the purpose of this set of docs is to showcase my writing, I have to keep it as is for now.*
